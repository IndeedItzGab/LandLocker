# LandLocker V1.0.8
- Revamped administrative commands where it can now be only executed by a operator. Therefore, `Admin` tag is no longer necessary for these commands.
- Fixed an issue where the particles won't show after having a claim in an unloaded chunks. Furthermore, annoying errors in the console have been removed.
- Fixed unnoticable issue with overlapped particles where it doesn't get removed after a few seconds as expected.

# LandLocker V1.0.7
*I apologize for uploading LandLocker V1.0.6 that doesn't work at all because of a minor issue. Therefore, the issue is now fixed.*

- Implementation of auto updater. Therefore, you can now use this project if you recently use LandLocker V1.0.4 in your server/world/realm perfectly.
- Fixed an issue where the whole project won't work because of a minor issue.

[Test the claims if they'll get automatically deleted. If so, fix it.]

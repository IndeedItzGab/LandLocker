  # LandLocker V1.0.9
  - Improvement with the performance when showing the claims. It will no longer relies on the custom entities location to spawn particles.
  - Revamped claim viewing
    - When resizing claim with tool, it will now show all claim that the player own.
    - When claiming a claim with tool, it will now only show the claimed land after claiming.
  - Fixed issue with resizing, claiming, and investigating blocks with tools (Buggy because of the update that I was not aware of).
  - Fixed issue where other players can resize your claim.

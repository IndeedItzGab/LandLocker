  # LandLocker V1.0.8
  This version is now considered as stable. Therefore, you can expect less or no issues.
  - Revamped administrative commands where it can now be only executed by a operator. Therefore, `Admin` tag is no longer necessary for these commands.
  - Fixed an issue where the particles won't show after having a claim in an unloaded chunks. Furthermore, annoying errors in the console have been removed.
  - Fixed unnoticable issue with overlapped particles where it doesn't get removed after a few seconds as expected.

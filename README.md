This is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition Add-On that is pretty much related or a port of [GriefPrevention](https://legacy.griefprevention.com/) to give players the right to claim a land that prevents other unauthorize players or damage to cause any griefs in the claimed land.

## Instalation
First, you must download the LandLocker pack that you can find in the [release section](https://github.com/IndeedItzGab/LandLocker/releases/). After that, import it with your minecraft. Once it's imported, you can now apply it to a world or realm. The "BETA APIs" experimental feature must be enabled.

You can now play with the the LandLocker!

## Feature
While we currently developing LandLocker, these are the following available features:
- Claim a land.
- Resizing the land with a Golden Shovel.
- Protects your land from explosions, destroying blocks, placing blocks, and interacting with blocks and mobs.
- Trust a player if they can do anything in your land, access your containers like chests, let them only use the buttons and levers, or grant them a permission to share their level of permissions.
- Combat is disabled to a player with a empty inbentory.
- Custom slash commands, see [Commands List](docs/COMMANDS.md)
more features will be added in the near future!

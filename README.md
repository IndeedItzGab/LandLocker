This is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition Add-On that is inspired by [GriefPrevention](https://legacy.griefprevention.com/) to give players the right to claim a land that prevents other unauthorize players or damage to cause any griefs in the claimed land.

## Instalation
First, you must download the LandLocker pack that you can find in the [release section](https://github.com/IndeedItzGab/LandLocker/releases/). After that, import it with your minecraft. Once it's imported, you can now apply it to a world or realm. The "BETA APIs" experimental feature must be enabled.
